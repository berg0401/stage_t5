# BehaviorTree.ROS

[BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) is a __middleware independent__ framework 
to develop Behavior Trees in C++.

The library is not particularly opinionated about the way Actions and Conditions should be created; this gives
more freedom to the developer, but can also be confusing for those people which are getting started with it.

Consequently, many people in the [ROS](http://www.ros.org) community asked for examples and guidelines;
this repository try to provide some basic examples.

Currently, two wrappers are provided:

- [RosServiceNode](include/behaviortree_ros/bt_service_node.h), which can be used to call
  [ROS Services](http://wiki.ros.org/Services)

- [RosActionNode](include/behaviortree_ros/bt_action_node.h) that, similarly, is a wrapper around
  [actionlib::SimpleActionClient](http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib).

The action that is ran is the default test_bt that is given by the behaviorTree.ROS library. It runs the AddTwoInts service and the Fibonacci sequence action. The intern modified the test_bt.cpp file in
